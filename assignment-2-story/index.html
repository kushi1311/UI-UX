                    <p class="paraB">Veer had grown up beneath this false sky, in the tunnels of Pataal Lok, where the air was thick with the scent of rust and recycled water. The ruling class, the Yamrajas, controlled everything—water, knowledge, even the right to a name. The Nameless were assigned numbers instead.

                    <p class="paraB">A great cavern stretched before him, its walls towering like the ribs of some ancient beast. A stone bridge arched gracefully over a still pool, its waters reflecting the dim light that filtered through unseen crevices above. The steps leading down were worn smooth, as if countless feet had once walked this path, though no sign of life remained. Further ahead, the tunnel curved into a hollowed-out chamber, its entrance carved into a perfect spiral, leading downward into deeper darkness.

                        But then he found the Codex of Raktbeej.
                        It was buried beneath the sands of a forgotten chamber, hidden within the depths of Pataal Lok. The place was unlike any other Veer had seen—a vast underground expanse, where nature and time had sculpted a world beneath the surface.

                    <p class="paraB">And there, half-buried in the golden sand near the entrance of this cavern, lay the Codex. A stone tablet, covered in intricate carvings, its symbols whispering of a time long before the rule of the Yamrajas. Veer brushed away the dust with trembling fingers, revealing the knowledge that had been stolen from his people.

                        The Trials of Ascendancy were held once every decade. The Nameless believed that the winners would be granted status, wealth, and a place among the Yamrajs.
